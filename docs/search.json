    "text": "How assignments and exams work in this class\n\nWritten Homework: Students must also type all work and explanations for ments and write complete sentences in context. Students must also copy and paste screenshots from the Applet website into the written homework. It is essential to start as early as possible, put effort into these assignments, and seek help to complete each assignment fully and as accurately as possible. All written homework should be written clearly. Plagiarism is using others’ ideas and/or words without clearly acknowledging the source of that information (intentional or unintentional). Cutting and pasting from a website is plagiarism. Copying homework is plagiarism. Any paper or assignment suspected of plagiarism will receive a zero.\nComputer Homework: Computer homework problems can be attempted repeatedly up to the due date. Many of the problems include video help or similar resources. After the due date passes, students can access those homework problems in “review mode,” which means that the problems can be practiced, but the scores won’t count in the gradebook.\nComputer Quizzes: Computer quizzes contain a small selection of problems from the computer homework, and students only get one attempt at the quiz. The quizzes are timed, and no help features are available during the quizzes. Students must complete quizzes independently without accessing other resources or working with others.\nIn-class Quizzes: In-class quizzes will be written on paper and take place during the class period. The quizzes will assess concepts from the class or previous classes.\nIn-class Activities: Students will solve in-class activities during the class. These activities can be: Discussion-based activities (think-pair-share): Students individually reflect on a question or topic, discuss their thoughts with a partner, and finally share their ideas with the larger group.\n\nProblem-solving activities: Students analyze real-world scenarios and apply their knowledge to develop solutions (case studies). Also, students take on different roles and simulate real-life situations, such as a job interview or a negotiation (role-playing).\nCreative activities: short writing assignments (writing exercises). Students present their research, projects, or ideas to the class (presentations).\nTechnology-based activities: online quizzes and polls, interactive simulations, and collaborative online activities using tools like Google Docs.\n\nExam corrections (Exam 1, Exam 2, and Exam 3): You should write on printer paper your own correction of each question of each chapter exam and submit a pdf file in the place posted in Brightspace the next class after you receive your exam grade paper.\nExam corrections discussion (Exam 1, Exam 2, and Exam 3): You must set an office hours appointment in the fol- lowing two weeks of the exam to discuss one exam correction (Exam 1, Exam 2, or Exam 3) with the instructor.\nExit tickets: At the end of each class, you should answer the questions asked in the exit ticket survey posted in Brightspace under the class topic section.\nChapter Exams: Exams in this class take place in the classroom and will be written on paper.\nCumulative Final Exam: This will be a written exam during the final class, held in the classroom.\nYou must go to MyDCC website to confirm the final schedule How assignments and exams work in this class:"

The two lowest grades from Computer Homework and Computer Quizzes assignments are dropped at the end of the semester. Students can submit any Computer Homework and Computer Quizzes assignment early if they have a pre-known scheduling conflict. If a last-minute situation causes a student to miss a due date for Computer Homework and Computer Quiz, the grade will be used as one of the drops or a 0 (after all drops have already been used). Do not bother to contact the instructor with excuses about missed computer homework; the reason is irrelevant. I drop two to allow for two of these life circumstances. Two are dropped. After that, any missed assignments will count as 0.\nAbsence/Late policy for Written Homework: Written Homework assignments are NEVER accepted late for any reason. The lowest written homework assignment grade is dropped at the end of the semester. Students can submit any written homework assignment early if there is a pre-known scheduling conflict. If a last-minute situation causes a student to miss a due date for one of these written homework assignments, the grade will be dropped, and any further missed assignments will count as a 0 in the gradebook. Do not bother to contact the instructor with excuses about missed written homework; the reason is irrelevant. I drop one to allow for one of these life circumstances. One is dropped. After one, any further missed assignments will count as a 0.\nAbsence/late policy for in-class quizzes and Exams: If a student can’t take an exam or In-class quiz on the day of the assessment: – Students must contact the instructor that day or before that day with an email to henry.mendozarivera@sunydutchess.edu with a valid excuse. Failing to contact the teacher that day or before with a valid reason will result in a zero on the assessment. – Within 24 hours, students must have the makeup assessment scheduled with the instructor. This means students must check their email after sending the initial email and then reply to the instructor to schedule the make-up assessment WITHIN 24 HOURS. – Makeup assessments must be completed within 48 hours of the original in-class assessment. After that, students will not be allowed to complete a makeup assessment, and a grade of 0 will be recorded. This policy allows for graded assessments to be returned promptly to all other students in the class. – Remember that one In-class quiz grade is dropped, and the unit exam replaces the lowest In-class quiz grade for each unit. Also, the final exam score will replace the lowest unit exam grade if it helps the student’s overall grade. So, students who miss a In-class quiz or exam and can’t make it up within 48 hours have other options for replacing that grade of 0.\nReschedule the final exam: Only a conflict with a final exam from another class is a reason to reschedule the final exam. Any student who does not take the final exam at the department’s scheduled time or at an agreed time due to a conflict will receive a score of 0.\nPlanned absences: For planned absences such as religious holidays, court appearances, or field trips, you must make arrangements with me in ADVANCE so you can take the test early."

But, please always remember that the work and answers given on quizzes and exams in the course must be only your work and answers. Work and answers should never come from external sources.\nStudents suspected of academic dishonesty will receive a 0 on the assignment/quiz/exam and be asked to meet with the instructor to discuss. An incident report will also be submitted to the college, as is DCC policy. Any student who has a 2nd incident of academic dishonesty on an assignment/quiz/unit exam or is found to have violated academic honesty policies on the proctored final exam will receive an automatic course grade of 0."

Arriving late is disruptive to other students. Students are expected to have completed the assigned work and have questions ready. You can expect to be asked to work together to solve problems and share ideas. You are expected to take notes and have your notes available from the reading that you have been assigned.\nPlease arrange all of your personal appointments around class time (i.e. Doctor, advisor, employment). Take care of personal business during your personal time, not class time.\nRarely can a student be successful in statistics without significant practice outside of the classroom! For college-level mathematics, it is relatively standard to spend two (2) hours working on course material outside of the classroom for every one hour (1) of classroom instruction. This means at least 9 hours will be spent on this course. Please plan your time accordingly. Time management will be an important key in your college experience. Time must be spent reading the textbook, reviewing your notes, doing homework, meeting with classmates for review, and scheduling time in the math center if needed."

Students are expected to recognize these values and adhere to all aspects of student conduct and academic honesty inside and outside of the classroom. The College regards academic dishonesty in any form as a breach of academic ethics and may result in disciplinary action. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following: * Cheating on examinations * Plagiarism: representing another’s ideas or writing as one’s own. Examples include: – presenting all or part of another person’s published work as something one has written; – paraphrasing or summarizing another’s writing without proper acknowledgment (citation); – representing another’s artistic or technical work or creation as one’s own. * Willingly collaborating with others in any of the above actions results in work being submitted that is not the student’s own. * Submitting work containing any content generated by an artificial intelligence bot or website when not explicitly directed to do so by the instructor. * Stealing examinations, taking electronic images, falsifying academic records, and other offenses. * Knowingly permitting another student to use one’s work or cheat from one’s examination. • Submitting work previously presented in another course without permission of instructor. • Unauthorized duplication of computer software. • Unauthorized use of copyrighted or published material. If, based on substantial evidence, an instructor deems that a student is responsible for a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, the instructor may take the following actions: * The instructor may require that the student repeat the assignment or examination, or * The instructor may give the student a failing grade for the assignment or examination, or • The instructor may give the student a failing grade for the course. As an institution of higher education, it is incumbent on the College to ensure that students understand and uphold the highest standards of academic honesty and that there be accountability in cases where students repeatedly violate those principles. To build an intellectual culture of academic integrity and ensure that students learn appropriate behavior in their academic endeavors, faculty, and staff who judge that a student intentionally violates the Academic Integrity Policy shall report said violation to the Office of Academic Affairs. The Office of Academic Affairs, in consultation with faculty and staff, will be responsible for developing and implement- ing appropriate academic administrative reporting procedures, educational interventions, disciplinary actions, and appeal processes. Students’ right to privacy will be upheld, and all students shall have the right to appeal any action that results from this process."
