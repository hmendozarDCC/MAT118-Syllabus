## Course Description and Purpose
Satisfies the mathematics requirement of the associate in Arts degree program. Basic statistical procedures are developed. Topics include descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals and regression using both simulation and a theory-based approach. Technology will be used regularly throughout the course. 

**Pre-requisites and/or co-requisites:**
Placement level 2 (see DCC math placement table), OR ENG101 placement level or higher, OR High School GPA of 3.0 (83) or higher.

## Course Learning Outcomes
Students who successfully complete the course will be able to:

* Calculate and use descriptive statistics (center, variation, outliers).
* Understand probability and interpret p-values.
* Use Central Limit Theorem and simulation for inferences.
* Construct/interpret confidence intervals.
* Use hypothesis testing to test claims.
* Use technology for statistical simulations.
* Perform correlation and regression analysis.

## Institutional Student Learning Outcomes

* **ISLO #4: Quantitative Reasoning.** Students will work with graphical, numerical, or symbolic models to solve problems and interpret results.

## AI Policy

Students in this course must not use AI in any way to generate material for any assignment unless explicitly instructed by the teacher to do so.
