## How assignments and exams work in this class


* **Written Homework:** Students must also type all work and explanations for
ments and write complete sentences in context. Students must also copy and paste screenshots from the Applet website into the written homework. It is essential to start as early as possible, put effort into these assignments, and seek help to complete each assignment fully and as accurately as possible.
All written homework should be written clearly. Plagiarism is using others’ ideas and/or words without clearly acknowledging the source of that information (intentional or unintentional). Cutting and pasting from a website is plagiarism. Copying homework is plagiarism. Any paper or assignment suspected of plagiarism will receive a zero.
* **Computer Homework:** Computer homework problems can be attempted repeatedly up to the due date. Many of the problems include video help or similar resources. After the due date passes, students can access those homework problems in “review mode,” which means that the problems can be practiced, but the scores won’t count in the gradebook.
* **Computer Quizzes:** Computer quizzes contain a small selection of problems from the computer homework, and students only get one attempt at the quiz. The quizzes are timed, and no help features are available during the quizzes. Students must complete quizzes independently without accessing other resources or working with others.
* **In-class Quizzes:** In-class quizzes will be written on paper and take place during the class period. The quizzes will assess concepts from the class or previous classes.
* **In-class Activities:** Students will solve in-class activities during the class. These activities can be:
Discussion-based activities (think-pair-share): Students individually reflect on a question or topic, discuss their thoughts with a partner, and finally share their ideas with the larger group.


Problem-solving activities: Students analyze real-world scenarios and apply their knowledge to develop solutions (case studies). Also, students take on different roles and simulate real-life situations, such as a job interview or a negotiation (role-playing).


Creative activities: short writing assignments (writing exercises). Students present their research, projects, or ideas to the class (presentations).

Technology-based activities: online quizzes and polls, interactive simulations, and collaborative online activities using tools like Google Docs.

* **Exam corrections (Exam 1, Exam 2, and Exam 3):** You should write on printer paper your own correction of each question of each chapter exam and submit a pdf file in the place posted in Brightspace the next class after you receive your exam grade paper.
* **Exam corrections discussion (Exam 1, Exam 2, and Exam 3):** You must set an office hours appointment in the fol- lowing two weeks of the exam to discuss one exam correction (Exam 1, Exam 2, or Exam 3) with the instructor.
* **Exit tickets:** At the end of each class, you should answer the questions asked in the exit ticket survey posted in Brightspace under the class topic section.
* **Chapter Exams:** Exams in this class take place in the classroom and will be written on paper.

* **Cumulative Final Exam:** This will be a written exam during the final class, held in the classroom.

* You must go to MyDCC website to confirm the final schedule
How assignments and exams work in this class:


## Absence and Late Work Policy

* Absence/Late Policy for Computer homework and Computer Quizzes:
Computer Homework and Computer Quizzes are NEVER accepted late for any reason. The two lowest grades from Computer Homework and Computer Quizzes assignments are dropped at the end of the semester. Students can submit any Computer Homework and Computer Quizzes assignment early if they have a pre-known scheduling conflict. If a last-minute situation causes a student to miss a due date for Computer Homework and Computer Quiz, the grade will be used as one of the drops or a 0 (after all drops have already been used). Do not bother to contact the instructor with excuses about missed computer homework; the reason is irrelevant. I drop two to allow for two of these life circumstances. Two are dropped. After that, any missed assignments will count as 0.

* Absence/Late policy for Written Homework:
Written Homework assignments are NEVER accepted late for any reason. The lowest written homework assignment grade is dropped at the end of the semester. Students can submit any written homework assignment early if there is a pre-known scheduling conflict. If a last-minute situation causes a student to miss a due date for one of these written homework assignments, the grade will be dropped, and any further missed assignments will count as a 0 in the gradebook. Do not bother to contact the instructor with excuses about missed written homework; the reason is irrelevant. I drop one to allow for one of these life circumstances. One is dropped. After one, any further missed assignments will count as a 0.

* Absence/late policy for in-class quizzes and Exams: If a student can’t take an exam or In-class quiz on the day of the assessment:
– Students must contact the instructor that day or before that day with an email to henry.mendozarivera@sunydutchess.edu with a valid excuse. Failing to contact the teacher that day or before with a valid reason will result in a zero on the assessment.
– Within 24 hours, students must have the makeup assessment scheduled with the instructor. This means students must check their email after sending the initial email and then reply to the instructor to schedule the make-up assessment WITHIN 24 HOURS.
– Makeup assessments must be completed within 48 hours of the original in-class assessment. After that, students will not be allowed to complete a makeup assessment, and a grade of 0 will be recorded. This policy allows for graded assessments to be returned promptly to all other students in the class.
– Remember that one In-class quiz grade is dropped, and the unit exam replaces the lowest In-class quiz grade for each unit. Also, the final exam score will replace the lowest unit exam grade if it helps the student’s overall grade. So, students who miss a In-class quiz or exam and can’t make it up within 48 hours have other options for replacing that grade of 0.

* Reschedule the final exam: Only a conflict with a final exam from another class is a reason to reschedule the final exam. Any student who does not take the final exam at the department’s scheduled time or at an agreed time due to a conflict will receive a score of 0.

* Planned absences: For planned absences such as religious holidays, court appearances, or field trips, you must make arrangements with me in ADVANCE so you can take the test early.




## Academic dishonesty in Math courses:
* Academic Dishonesty is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. It is unfair for some students to earn a course grade based on work that is not their own while other students in the course are earning a course grade based only upon their work.
* In this modern era, when taking an online math course, it is tempting for some students to seek out answers to math questions with software, online resources/apps, artificial intelligence options, and other people. But, please always remember that the work and answers given on quizzes and exams in the course must be only your work and answers. Work and answers should never come from external sources.
* Students suspected of academic dishonesty will receive a 0 on the assignment/quiz/exam and be asked to meet with the instructor to discuss. An incident report will also be submitted to the college, as is DCC policy. Any student who has a 2nd incident of academic dishonesty on an assignment/quiz/unit exam or is found to have violated academic honesty policies on the proctored final exam will receive an automatic course grade of 0.



## How students should approach the course every day:
* Read the book section and ACTIVELY try the examples yourself. After you have tried an example, only then should you view the solution (so you can check your work). Passively reading won’t help much! You need to try the problems yourself actively. Learning math requires DOING the math.
* Watch the videos. Again, you should ACTIVELY try the examples in the video by pausing the video and trying yourself. Then, un-pause the video and check that you got the correct solution.
* Attend class. We will give examples and answer questions. Questions from classmates and examples you have done together can benefit your learning.
* Complete the Brightspace homework. Re-practice problems that you had trouble with. Ask for help from your teacher and the Math and Science Center tutors as needed.
* Complete the Brightspace Quiz once you feel comfortable with the Computer Homework problems.
* Seek help from your instructor and the Math and Science Center tutors!

## Extra Help for Success:
* Brightspace Reading and Videos:
The online textbook and videos have examples similar to problems you will find on your homework and assessments.
* Computer Practice:
These computer practice problems can be repeated repeatedly (even after the due date...although they are no longer
counted in your grade after the due date). You can go back and re-practice these throughout the semester.
* Your Instructor is here to help:
Please get in touch with your instructor consistently since the instructor is here to help you succeed. Students who seek out help from the instructor tend to do better in the course! You can message the instructor in Brightspace and/or email the instructor.
* Help from the Math & Science Center Tutors:
The Math & Science Center has free tutoring. The Math & Science Center is open for free drop-in face-to-face
tutoring and online tutoring.
Tutoring math and science center (Check the schedule here)

## Classroom Conduct:

* Respectful behavior toward everyone in the room is expected at all times. Individual conversations during class are distracting and disrespectful to the instructor and fellow students. Orderliness and organization are essential to learning. Questions and insights are welcomed when appropriate during class. Please refrain from using offensive language at any time.
* Be on time for the class meetings. Arriving late is disruptive to other students. Students are expected to have completed the assigned work and have questions ready. You can expect to be asked to work together to solve problems and share ideas. You are expected to take notes and have your notes available from the reading that you have been assigned.
* Please arrange all of your personal appointments around class time (i.e. Doctor, advisor, employment). Take care of personal business during your personal time, not class time.
* Rarely can a student be successful in statistics without significant practice outside of the classroom! For college-level mathematics, it is relatively standard to spend two (2) hours working on course material outside of the classroom for every one hour (1) of classroom instruction. This means at least 9 hours will be spent on this course. Please plan your time accordingly. Time management will be an important key in your college experience. Time must be spent reading the textbook, reviewing your notes, doing homework, meeting with classmates for review, and scheduling time in the math center if needed.

## Study Time 
You are expected to spend at least nine hours a week studying and participating in this class. Staring at the book does not count! What do you do with that time?
* Read the book, take notes from the assigned reading, and review class notes as necessary.
* Complete the assignments.
* Learn and be able to recite all formulas and calculator steps.
* Attempt all of the suggested homework on paper.
* Ask questions via email, in class, or in the Math and Science Center on the questions you didn’t understand.
* Pick a few more exercises to try to be sure you’ve “got it”.
* Do not spend all of your time on one homework question. Move on to other questions and then seek help for those you got stuck on.

## Academic Integrity Policy:
Dutchess Community College is committed to honesty, integrity, and ethical behavior. Students are expected to recognize these values and adhere to all aspects of student conduct and academic honesty inside and outside of the classroom. The College regards academic dishonesty in any form as a breach of academic ethics and may result in disciplinary action. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
* Cheating on examinations
* Plagiarism: representing another’s ideas or writing as one’s own. Examples include:
– presenting all or part of another person’s published work as something one has written;
– paraphrasing or summarizing another’s writing without proper acknowledgment (citation); – representing another’s artistic or technical work or creation as one’s own.
* Willingly collaborating with others in any of the above actions results in work being submitted that is not the student’s own.
* Submitting work containing any content generated by an artificial intelligence bot or website when not explicitly directed to do so by the instructor.
* Stealing examinations, taking electronic images, falsifying academic records, and other offenses.
* Knowingly permitting another student to use one’s work or cheat from one’s examination.
• Submitting work previously presented in another course without permission of instructor.
• Unauthorized duplication of computer software.
• Unauthorized use of copyrighted or published material.
If, based on substantial evidence, an instructor deems that a student is responsible for a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, the instructor may take the following actions:
* The instructor may require that the student repeat the assignment or examination, or
* The instructor may give the student a failing grade for the assignment or examination, or • The instructor may give the student a failing grade for the course.
As an institution of higher education, it is incumbent on the College to ensure that students understand and uphold the highest standards of academic honesty and that there be accountability in cases where students repeatedly violate those principles. To build an intellectual culture of academic integrity and ensure that students learn appropriate behavior in their academic endeavors, faculty, and staff who judge that a student intentionally violates the Academic Integrity Policy shall report said violation to the Office of Academic Affairs.
The Office of Academic Affairs, in consultation with faculty and staff, will be responsible for developing and implement- ing appropriate academic administrative reporting procedures, educational interventions, disciplinary actions, and appeal processes. Students’ right to privacy will be upheld, and all students shall have the right to appeal any action that results from this process.

## My policy is as follows:
* In the case of a first academic dishonesty offense, the student will receive a score of zero for the unit exam, homework, or quiz on which the student has submitted work violating the academic honesty policy. In the case of a second offense of academic dishonesty on a homework, quiz, or unit exam, the student will receive an F in the course overall.
* Any academic dishonesty on the final exam will result in an F in the course overall.
* The final exam grade will not be used to replace any 0 earned on a unit exam due to academic dishonesty. Any 0
earned from academic dishonesty will remain as a grade of 0.
* All instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to the college, as is DCC policy.

## Starfish
Starfish is an online student engagement tool used to connect students to faculty, staff and support services across campus. Instructors may provide feedback in Starfish that will help the student and advisor/academic coach understand how a student is doing in a class, so that support can be provided if needed to facilitate student success. Please check your myDCC email and log into Starfish daily. Additionally, through Starfish students can access individualized advisement in the ACT Center.

## AI Policy
AI is an emerging technology. It is inaccurate, so students must not use AI to try and ”fact-find” unless they follow up with their own legitimate research. Students in this course must not use AI in any way to generate material for any assignment unless explicitly instructed by the teacher to do so.
